I built a project which you can find publicly in 'http://cleverwearer.com'. This project is about to help people to get dressed for the weather and plan users wardrobe for the trips, and also warning users about surprises of the nature.

I built it with ASP.NET MVC + WebAPI engine, it continues to grow and I have lots of ideas to implement. So, please visit it and share with me any suggestions, comments, etc.
